                        <p>Meeting new people is exciting, but you should always be cautious when interacting with
                            someone you don’t know. Use your best judgment and put your safety first, whether you are
                            exchanging initial messages or meeting in person. While you can’t control the actions of
                            others, there are things you can do to help you stay safe during your Tinder experience.</p>

                                <p>Never send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person claims to be in
                                    an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash —&nbsp;it’s nearly impossible to
                                    reverse the transaction or trace where the money went. Never share information that
                                    could be used to access your financial accounts. If another user asks you for money,
                                    report it to us immediately.</p>

                                    every Monday) with people you don’t know. If you are a parent, limit the information
                                    that you share about your children on your profile and in early communications.
                                    Avoid sharing details such as your children’s names, where they go to school, or

                                    especially if they ask for financial help to return home. Be wary of anyone who will

                                    without meeting or getting to know you first —&nbsp;that’s a red flag.</p>

                                    contracting and passing on STI’s like HIV. But, be aware of STIs like herpes or HPV
                                    that can be passed on through skin-to-skin contact. The risk of contracting some

                                    about sexual health and STI testing. And be aware —&nbsp;in some places, it’s
                                    actually a crime to knowingly pass on an STI. Need help starting the conversation?

                                <p>All sexual activity must start with consent and should include ongoing check-ins with
                                    your partner. Verbal communication can help you and your partner ensure that you
                                    respect each other’s boundaries. Consent can be withdrawn at any time, and sex is
                                    never owed to anyone. Do not proceed if your partner seems uncomfortable or unsure,
                                    or if your partner is unable to consent due to the effects of drugs or alcohol. Read
