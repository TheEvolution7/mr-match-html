                        <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
                        <p>Welcome to Mr.Match!<br>Mr.Match is where meaningful connections can happen. It Starts With a
                            Swipe™.&nbsp;Sometimes you click. Sometimes you don’t. And sometimes the talking leads to
                            more. Opportunity is overflowing. Possibilities are endless. All (adults) are welcome to
                            come explore.</p>
                        <p>We want Mr.Match to be a fun, safe and inclusive space where anyone can be themselves while
                            getting to know others. <b>That’s what these Community Guidelines are for–to set
                                expectations for everyone’s behavior, both on and off of the app.</b>&nbsp;So read on;
                            not following these guidelines can have real consequences-from a nudge to a ban.</p>
                        <h2>Mr.Match's Rules:</h2>
                        <div id="consider-boundaries" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div>
                        <p>
                        <div id="consider-boundaries" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>1. Consider
                            boundaries. </b>Comfort levels vary person to person. That’s why we don’t allow nudity,
                        sexual content, sexual desires, or looking for sex on your public profile. If you are in a
                        private conversation, these are okay if everyone is okay with it. Consent matters.</p>
                        <p>
                        <div id="share-cautiously" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>2. Share cautiously
                            and thoughtfully</b>. Don’t publicly broadcast your personal information or ways for people
                        to connect with you (no public displays of things like phone numbers, emails, or social
                        handles). Sharing out your bank account numbers or email password&nbsp;is always a bad idea.
                        Don’t ask others to send you their personal details either. Be cautious when sending money to
                        other people.&nbsp;Or maybe don’t at all.</p>
                        <p>
                        <div id="violent-content" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>3. Steer clear of
                            violent content.</b>&nbsp;We promote positivity and won’t tolerate any sort of violent
                        content that contains gore, death, images or descriptions of violent acts (against humans or
                        animals), use of weapons, and anything advocating or glorifying self-harm.</p>
                        <p>If we believe there’s a risk of imminent harm, we may&nbsp;take steps to assist, like
                            reaching out directly with crisis resources.</p>
                        <p>
                        <div id="no-advertising" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>4. Make personal
                            connections, not biz ones.</b>&nbsp;Don’t advertise, promote, share your social handles to
                        gain followers, sell stuff, fundraise, or campaign. This also means Mr.Match isn’t the place for
                        any sort of sex work, escort services, or compensated relationships. So, no–don’t use Mr.Match to
                        find your sugarmamma.</p>
                        <p>
                        <div id="just-be-you" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>5. Just be you.</b>
                        People want to meet the real you. Not your fake persona. Don’t create a fake account&nbsp;or
                        pretend to be someone you’re not, even if it’s just for fun.</p>
                        <p>
                        <div id="respect" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>6. Communicate
                            Respectfully.</b>&nbsp;Talking to new people can be tricky, especially when you’re
                        interacting with humans from all walks of life. Respect goes a long way.</p>
                        <p>If the convo goes unexpectedly awry and you find yourself getting upset or feeling
                            angry–pause and reflect before you react. Harassment, threats, bullying, intimidation,
                            doxing, sextortion, blackmail, or anything intentionally done to cause harm is not allowed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr.Match is not a place for hate. We will never stand behind racism, bigotry, hatred, or
                            violence based on who someone is, how they identify or what they look like. This includes
                            (but not limited to) someone’s race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability,
                            physicality, gender, gender identity, age, national origin, or sexual orientation. If you
                            see someone who doesn't meet your personal criteria, don't like them or unmatch and move on.
                            Don't report them unless you think they've violated our policies.</p>
                        <p>
                        <div id="do-no-harm" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>7. Lead with kindness, not
                            harm.</b>&nbsp;Any acts or behavior that suggests, intends, or causes harm to another member
                        - either on or offline, physically or digitally - will be taken very seriously. This includes
                        anything calling for or inciting harm.</p>
                        <p>If you have been hurt by someone on Mr.Match: first, please take care of yourself, and second,
                            take some time to decide what you need to heal, whether that be accountability measures,
                            disclosure, support, or all of the above.&nbsp;If this includes reporting the harm to us,
                            please reach out. We are here for you.</p>
                        <p>
                        <div id="adults-only" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>8. Adults
                            only.</b>&nbsp;You must be 18 years of age or older to use Mr.Match. This also means we don’t
                        allow photos of unaccompanied or unclothed minors, including photos of your younger self–no
                        matter how adorable you were back then.</p>

                        <div id="no-illegal-content" class="LinkableArea-sc-1repp5z-0 UhZpP"></div><b>9. Abide by the
                            law.</b>&nbsp;No illegal content or activities are allowed, ever. This means you can’t use
                        Mr.Match to buy or sell drugs or counterfeit goods, or ask for assistance to help you break the
                        law. We definitely won’t tolerate anyone using Mr.Match to advocate or participate in any sort of
                        harm involving minors or human trafficking.</p>

                        reasons, we can’t support multiple people accessing the same account, each individual needs to
                        have their own.</p>

                            member of the Mr.Match community.</b>&nbsp;Don’t abuse Mr.Match. Don’t use Mr.Match to spread
                        false or misleading info. Don’t spam harmful links or unsolicited content. Don’t create mass

                        else. Don’t submit misleading reports. Don’t use third-party apps to unlock features or game the

                            stay active.</b>&nbsp;If you don’t log into your Mr.Match account in two years, we’ll assume
                        it’s zzZZzzZ and may delete it for inactivity. So if you want to be seen in the app, just log in

                            Guidelines–report it. Your report is always confidential.&nbsp;By reporting, you can help us
