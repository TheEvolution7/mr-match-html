                    <p><span><span>At Mr.Match, we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. The GDPR,
                                effective as of May 25, 2018, is a pivotal law under EU legislation that aims to
                                strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU).
                                It sets forth rigorous new rules on data privacy, which we are fully committed to
                                complying with, in order to ensure that your personal information is safe, secure, and

                    <p><span><span><strong>17. Why GDPR Matters</strong></span></span></p>



                    <p><span><span>17.1 The GDPR is designed to: Enhance Privacy Rights: The regulation provides EU
                                residents with greater control over their personal data and assurances that their
                                information is being securely protected across Europe.</span></span></p>



                    <p><span><span>17.2 Simplify the Regulatory Environment: By unifying data protection regulations
                                within the European Union, GDPR simplifies the regulatory environment for both
                                businesses and individuals.</span></span></p>



                    <p><span><span>17.3 Increase Credibility and Trust: Compliance helps ensure that organizations are
                                operating transparently and in the best interests of the data they manage.</span></span>
