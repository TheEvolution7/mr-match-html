                            to you how you can manage them.</p>

                            settings? </h2>

                        <p>Happy to explain! Keep on reading.</p>
                        <p><i>Note: This Cookie Policy does not address how we process your personal information outside
                                of our usage of cookies. To learn more about how we process your personal information,
                                please read our </i><a href="privacy.html"><i>Privacy Policy</i></a><i>.</i></p>
                        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
                        <p>Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your
                            device’s memory. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from
                            which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a
                            randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain
                            information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities
                            conducted while using our services.</p>
                        <h2>Are there different types of cookies?</h2>
                        <h3>First-party and third-party cookies</h3>
                        <p>There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your
                            device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your
                            browser’s language preferences and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party
                            cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. You can learn more
                            about these partners and service providers through our website and in-app consent management
                            tools. For details on these tools, see <i>“How can you control cookies?”</i> below.</p>
                        <h3>Session and persistent cookies</h3>
                        <p>There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close
                            your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about
                            your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website
                            more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and last beyond the current
                            session. These types of cookies can be used to help you quickly sign-in to our website
                            again, for analytical purposes and for other reasons as described below.</p>
                        <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons and SDKs?</h2>
                        <p>Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixel, tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs
                            or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes as cookies. Web beacons
                            are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when
                            someone has visited our service or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. Tracking URLs
                            are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our webpages comes
                            from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web
                            beacons.</p>
                        <p>For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.</p>
                        <h2>What do we use cookies for?</h2>
                        <p>Like other providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our
                            services, including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our
                            website, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns and personalizing and tailoring
                            ads to your interests. To accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from
                            cookies with other personal information we hold about you.</p>
                        <p>When you use our services, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your

                        <h3>Browser and devices controls</h3>
                        <p>Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert
                            you when a cookie is placed on your computer. The procedure for managing cookies is slightly

                        <p>Opting out does not mean that you will not see advertising - it means you won’t see
                            personalized advertising from the companies that participate in the opt-out programs. Also,
                            if you delete cookies on your device after you opted out, you will need to opt-out again.
